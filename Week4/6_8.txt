6/8

Started studying and making changes to the existing Flutter codebase for Cue-Cetera.
Prototyping the page I'm in charge of, which should display the video that was classified,
with timestamps, classification, and a changeable progress bar.

Potentially want to see if I can refactor all the flutter code to make it cleaner and easy to extend.
Would also want to overhaul a lot of the UI, it is currently not very pretty.
