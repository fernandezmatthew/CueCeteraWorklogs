Tested Chewie's video player with a different aspect ratio, had no issues. Figured out how to make a
timestamp button that will change where the user is in the video.
Will now work to generate a list of those timestamp objects (defined as its own class) with their own data, such
as color.
This list of timestamps will be scrollable if need be, either using scrollviewsinglechild or listview.build object.
