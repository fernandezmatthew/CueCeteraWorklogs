# im1.save() will save the image to a new file (can change the extension here if we want
# im1.show() will display the image using idk

# we can use image.blend ONLY IF we knew the size of every frame in a video and
# converted all the thumbs to be in the bottom right corner of an image of the same size.
# kinda cringe so i dont think so

# image.composite also requires two images of the same size, and also needs a mask. kinda interpolates
# between the two images, at least in L mode for first argument.

# image.paste is what we're looking for!!!!!!!!!!! arg1 = image we want to paste to base, and
# arg2 is where we want to paste that image

# lets resize our thumb to be proportional to the background image. we want to be 1/40th of the area
# can't use the thumbnail method because this wont allow us to make our thumbs larger if need be
# instead we will use ImageOps to do a resize that maintains asepect ratio
thumb = ImageOps.contain(thumb, (testFrame.width // 6, testFrame.height // 6))

# let's paste our thumb to the bottom right of the image
# how could we add padding?
widthPadding = testFrame.width // 35
heightPadding = testFrame.height // 35
padding = (widthPadding + heightPadding) // 2
pasteCoord = (testFrame.width - thumb.width - padding, testFrame.height - thumb.height - padding)

testFrame.paste(thumb, pasteCoord, thumb.convert('RGBA')) # the last arg gives transparency
