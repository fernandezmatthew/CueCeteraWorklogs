This repository contains the hours I have worked on the Cue-Cetera project.

My goal for the month of May is to contribute 30 hours of work, and to deliver a report and presentation
demonstrating that work.

My goal for the work itself is to create a new page on the front-end of the application that pulls images from
Firebase and displays them with machine-assigned classifications.
