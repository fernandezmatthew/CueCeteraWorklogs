Group meeting discussing the alpha feedback and giving a progress update.
Currently making good process on my python image manipulation, able to paste the thumb
image onto the bottom right corner of a given image. Working to properly resize that
thumb image now based on the frame size. 
The next steps will be paste a certain image based on the classication of the current time window,
then to convert all of the frames into a single mp4 that we can ship to the front end.
