9/23

Doing a lot of research on saving files, and trying many different packages. 
Wanted to note here, might want to use path_provider to make sure we're deleting our file'
on app close?
tried using gal package but didnt really work. Trying to use request system dialog now.
At the end of the day, got the video to download to the android's local files using system dialog package.
User expected to have decent knowledge of file types, which is a little annoying.

Unsure how practical it would be to burn the images into the video. depending on video
length and framerate, this could take a very long time, even if we figured out how to do it.

Gonna spend some time trying to add an image on top of another image using a python script.
if I can get this to work for one image, then i will try to do it to an entire video. I will note
how long these things take. Then we can make the decision to implement the feature or not.
