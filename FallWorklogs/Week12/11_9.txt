11/9

Went in to class to participate in user testing (only got feedback from carsten)
fixed a bug he pointed out where we could go back from the result_display page
made it so if you go back on that page you instead go the home screen after confirming
made it so the camera swap button disappears once you start recording
modularized the user settings into a UserSettings class.
made it the user cannot go back from the processing video page
changed the confirm back prompt to not insinuate classifications in the video
