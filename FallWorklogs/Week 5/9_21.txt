9/21

Had a meeting with the group and a meeting with Carsten.
Researched more into video manipulation, but also into file downloading
for after the video was changed.
Added some buttons to the taskbar on the result_display page for the download
(not implemented) and to return home, which pops up with an "Are 
you sure" message on tap.
