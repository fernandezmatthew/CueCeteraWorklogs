Finished designing the timestamp cards. Made it so they can be generated via
looping through a list. Thus, if we can generate a list of timestamps using
the data from firebase, we can generate the final product properly.

Also did some screensize formatting so our app foesnt only look okay on Pixel 5.

Would still like to do some organizational overhauls but it feels disrespectful to
the rest of the group 0.0
